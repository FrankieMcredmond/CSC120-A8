Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


My Class implements the contract class to make a game called Monster Mash, where you play a gelatinous cube. The cube can walk, fly, and use magical items to shrink or grow.

There is an energy meter, that depletes every time the monster walks. And you need to rest or use a magical item to regain energy.

There is also an undo function where the player can undo their latest action. But only some actions can be undone

I did not add any new methods

And if I had to give advice, don't save the weekly homework assignments for finals week *crying*.
